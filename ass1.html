<p style="color:black">
Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's climate system observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, 
which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere.
Since the Industrial Revolution, the global annual temperature has increased in total by a little more than 1 degree Celsius, or about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Between 1880—the year that accurate recordkeeping began—and 1980, it rose on average by 0.07 degrees Celsius (0.13 degrees Fahrenheit) every 10 years. 
Since 1981, however, the rate of increase has more than doubled: For the last 40 years, we’ve seen the global annual temperature rise by 0.18 degrees Celsius, 
or 0.32 degrees Fahrenheit, per decade.</p>

<h3 style="color:blue"><b><u>Definition of global warning</u></b></h3>

<p><b>An increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere, 
especially a sustained increase great enough to cause changes in the global climate. 
The Earth has experienced numerous episodes of global warming through its history, 
and currently appears to be undergoing such warming. 
The present warming is generally attributed to an increase in the greenhouse effect , 
brought about by increased levels of greenhouse gases, largely due to the effects of human industry and agriculture. 
Expected long-term effects of current global warming are rising sea levels, flooding, melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, 
fluctuations in temperature and precipitation, more frequent and stronger El Niños and La Niñas, drought, heat waves, 
and forest fires. See more at greenhouse effect.</b>

<h3 style="color:blue"><u>Main causes of global warming</u></h3>

<ol>
<li>
<h3><b>Green house  gases:</b></h3></li>
<p><i>Concentrations of the key greenhouse gases have all increased since the Industrial Revolution 
due to human activities. Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide concentrations are now more 
abundant in the earth’s atmosphere than any time in the last 800,000 years.
5 These greenhouse gas emissions have increased the greenhouse effect and 
caused the earth’s surface temperature to rise. Burning fossil fuels changes the climate 
more than any other human activity.</i>
<li><h3><b>Carbon dioxide: </b></h3></li>
<p>Human activities currently release over 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year.
6 Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have increased by more than 40 percent since pre-industrial times, 
from approximately 280 parts per million (ppm) in the 18th century7 to 414 ppm in 2020.8
</p>
<li><h3><b>Methane: </b></h3><p>Human activities increased methane concentrations during most of the 20th century to more than 2.5 times the pre-industrial level, 
from approximately 722 parts per billion (ppb) in the 18th century9 to 1,867 ppb in 2019.10
</p>

<li><h3><b>Nitrous oxide: </b></h3></li>
<p>Nitrous oxide concentrations have risen approximately 20 percent since the start of the Industrial Revolution, 
with a relatively rapid increase toward the end of the 20th century. 
Nitrous oxide concentrations have increased from a pre-industrial level of 270 ppb11 to 332 ppb in 2019.12

<h2 style="color:blue"> <u>how to solve global warming</u></h2>
<p>EDITOR’S NOTE: On April 4, 2022, the IPCC released the Working Group III Sixth Assessment report on 
climate change mitigation. The report describes how, despite gains in the clean energy revolution, 
nations are falling far too short of reducing climate pollution quickly enough to avoid severe damage, 
cost, and upheaval. “The good news is that we have the climate solutions needed, and they work,” 
says NRDC president Manish Bapna. “For our economic and national security, and for the future of all life on earth, 
lawmakers must act without delay.” 
</p>
<p>Rising sea levels. Raging storms. Searing heat. Ferocious fires. Severe drought. 
Punishing floods. The effects of climate change are already threatening our health, our communities, our economy, 
our security, and our children’s future.</p>

<p>
What can you do? A whole lot, as it turns out. Americans, on average, produce 21 tons of carbon a year, about four times the global average. 
Personal action is, of course, no substitute for meaningful government policies. 
We still must limit carbon pollution and aggressively move away from dirty fossil fuels toward cleaner power</p>
<p>

But it’s important to remember the equally vital contributions that can be made by private citizens—which is to say, by you. “Change only happens when individuals take action,” says clean energy advocate Aliya Haq. “There’s no other way, if it doesn’t start with people.”

</p>
<ul><li><b><h3>Speak up!</h3></b></li><p>
What’s the single biggest way you can make an impact on global climate change? “Talk to your friends and family, and make sure your representatives are making good decisions,” Haq says. By voicing your concerns—via social media or, better yet, directly to your elected officials—you send a message that you care about the warming world. Encourage Congress to enact new laws that limit carbon emissions and require polluters to pay for the emissions they produce. “The main reason elected officials do anything difficult is because their constituents make them,” Haq says. You can help protect public lands, stop offshore drilling, and more
</p>

<p>
<li><b><h3>Power your home with renewable energy</h3></b></li>
Choose a utility company that generates at least half its power from wind or solar and has been certified by Green-e Energy, an organization that vets renewable energy options. If that isn’t possible for you, take a look at your electric bill; many utilities now list other ways to support renewable sources on their monthly statements and websites.
</p>
<p>
<li><b><h3>Weatherize</h3></b></li>
<p>
“Building heating and cooling are among the biggest uses of energy,” Haq says. Indeed, heating and air-conditioning account for almost half of home energy use. You can make your space more energy efficient by sealing drafts and ensuring it’s adequately insulated. You can also claim federal tax credits for many energy efficiency home improvements. To help you figure out where to start, you could also get a home energy audit, which some utilities offer free of charge (alternatively, you can hire a professional to come to your home and perform one). The EPA’s Home Energy Yardstick gives 
you a simple assessment of your home’s annual energy use compared with similar homes
</p><li><b>Invest in energy-efficient appliances.</b></li>
<p>
Since they were first implemented nationally in 1987, efficiency standards for dozens of appliances and products have kept 2.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide out of the air. That’s about the same amount as the annual carbon pollution coughed up by nearly 440 million cars. “Energy efficiency is the lowest-cost way to reduce emissions,” Haq says. When shopping for refrigerators, washing machines, heat pump water heaters, and other appliances, look for the Energy Star label. It will tell you which are the most efficient. (There may also be rebates to earn from your purchase of Energy Star–certified products.)

And when you’re ready to swap out your old machines, don’t just put them on the curb: Recycling an old refrigerator through the EPA’s Responsible Appliance Disposal Program can prevent an additional 10,000 pounds of carbon pollution because the global-warming pollutants in the refrigerants and foam would be properly captured rather than vented to the air.

<li><b>
<h3><u>Reduce water waste</u></h3></b></li>
<p>
Saving water reduces carbon pollution, too. That's because it takes a lot of energy to pump, heat, 
and treat your water. So take shorter showers, turn off the tap while brushing your teeth, and switch to
 WaterSense-labeled fixtures and appliances. The EPA estimates that if just one out of every 100 American 
homes were retrofitted with water-efficient fixtures, about 100 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year 
would be saved—avoiding 80,000 tons of global warming pollution.
